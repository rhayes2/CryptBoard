# CryptBoard
CryptBoard is a keyboard application for Android devices that allows users to create and decode messages using a combination of RSA cryptography and Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. By hiding encrypted messages within the bit values of innocuous carrier images, which are subsequently attached to plain-text messages, CryptBoard allows users to both send and receive encrypted messages through unencrypted services and circumvent automated keyword-based censorship.

### Example App

|                            Encode                            |                            Decode                            |
